# arduino-samsung-navibot-remote-control
I found a Samsung Navibot vacuum cleaner in the dumpster that is  completely working, unfortunately the remote was not placed on the bin with the robot.  I found IR codes for it on the internet and built a remote for  it.

It's a Korean version of the Navibot series model Samsung VC-RL87W. It originally comes with a wifi router because it has an app for remote control and camera on the front.
